[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/scmer/badge/?version=latest)](https://scmer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest) [![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/scmer?color=blue&logo=pypi)](https://pypi.org/project/scmer)

SCMER is a feature selection methods designed for single-cell data analysis. 
It selects a compact sets of markers that preserve the manifold in the original data.
It can also be used for data integration by using features in one modality to match the manifold of another modality.
